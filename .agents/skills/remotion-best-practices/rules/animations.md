All animations MUST be driven by the `useCurrentFrame()` hook.  
Write animations in seconds and multiply them by the `fps` value from `useVideoConfig()`.

For eased motion, prefer `interpolate` with explicit frame ranges and an easing—especially `Easing.bezier`, which matches CSS `cubic-bezier` so timing can be shared with web specs and curve editors. See [timing](./timing.md).

```tsx
import { useCurrentFrame, Easing } from "remotion";

export const FadeIn = () => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const { fps } = useVideoConfig();

  const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 2 * fps], [0, 1], {
    extrapolateRight: "clamp",
    extrapolateLeft: "clamp",
    easing: Easing.bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1),
  });

  return <div style={{ opacity }}>Hello World!</div>;
};
```

CSS transitions or animations are FORBIDDEN - they will not render correctly.  
Tailwind animation class names are FORBIDDEN - they will not render correctly.
